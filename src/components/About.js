<body className="text">Living in the PacificNorthWest, Katie is always 
just a moment away from a beautiful landscape view, 
nature walk, hike or beach. Katie likes to hike but 
she is not the best at remembering names of places. 
If only there was an app that would allow Katie to 
choose a hike based solely on looks. With Timber that 
dream became a reality. Users, like Katie, can swipe 
through photos  of hikes and "swipe right" on hikes 
that they find attractive. Once they've matched with 
a hike they will be able to see more information 
about that hike thanks to Washington Trails Association 
(https://www.wta.org/). The user can then decide to 
meet the hike or keep swiping.</body>
